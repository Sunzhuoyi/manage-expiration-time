## manage-expiration-time
### What
It's an app that manages the expiration time of various items.
### Why
We often come across situations as follows:
+ when an emergency drug is needed,it is found to have expired, or it is not clear whether it has.
+ some cosmetic expiration dates are based on bottle opening time, but we often forget when we started using them.
### How
Now you can record the expiration time here, if there is a product is about to expire, it will remind you.
The plan is to provide three types of input: writing,selecting, or taking photos.
### The difference between MET and a memo
Memos keep track of events based on time,MET manages time based on events.
